# Basic-2d-Renderer
A simple 2D renderer that allows you to draw out shapes and apply rigid transformations to them.

This was written in C++ using the SFML library.

This originally started as a school project but I might work on it more.

## Build
To build the project you have to have Premake and Make installed

Go into the `/build/` directory and run
```premake```

This will build the Makefile

To build the release version, run
```make config=release```

Then go into the `/bin/Release/` directory and run
```.\Renderer.exe```
